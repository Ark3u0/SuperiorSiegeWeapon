Todo:

- Make target not float/line trajectory more accurate with ground
- Handle camera obstruction

- Show ball relative location when offscreen
- Show UI buttons of kick/interaction with NPCs, etc.
- Dialog trees and text boxes
- (BUG) releasing right trigger before ball is ready to kick makes ball track with player
- (BUG) fix issue where ball gets locked in unable to be kicked or detached state

Optional
- Enhance camera targeting with Slerp/Lerp transition to new position
- Enhance camera targeting with Slerp/Lerp to new zoom
- Show constraints on where player can kick
- (Experiment) trajectory with drag
