Todo:

- Make target not float/line trajectory more accurate
- (Experiment) trajectory with drag
- Handle camera obstruction

- Show ball relative location when offscreen
- Set constraints on where player can kick (i.e. not behind him, certain distance forward, etc.)
- Show constraints on where player can kick
- Show UI buttons of kick/interaction with NPCs, etc.
- Dialog trees and text boxes
- (BUG) releasing right trigger before ball is ready to kick makes ball track with player

Optional
- Enhance camera targeting with Slerp/Lerp transition to new position
- Enhance camera targeting with Slerp/Lerp to new zoom
